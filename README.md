# react-playground

A bunch of react projects to play with.

## Pojects

* [**native-pokedex**](./native-pokedex): inspired by the Jack Herrington's React State [course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bEzt5ISACA), it uses react and custom hooks and react context to list a pokemon list.
Demo: <TDB>.
